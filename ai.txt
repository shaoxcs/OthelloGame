Did you attempt to make your computer player very smart -- i.e., do something more clever than just pick a random legal move?
    Yes. If the player sets the GREEDY_AI to True in the Othello file, it will be much more clever than the random one.

If so, were you able to accomplish this? Is your computer player as smart as you would like?
    Yes, I was able to accomplish it. It acts exactly as I want.

How did you determine which piece to play next? Tell us about your “pick next move” algorithm
    Since the corners are definitely more valuable than other positions, AI checks them first and makes a greedy move if there is no valid move at corners. Therefore, the strategy is:
        1. Scan the corners of the board, if there is any legal move, put tile on it.
        2. Else: For every valid position in this turn:
            Calculate the maximum number of tiles that flip in all valid moves.
            If there is more than one move to get the max scores, randomly choose one from the greedy_list.
            Make a greedy move, getting the max score in every turn.

How often did your computer program beat you, or your friends, or whoever tested it out for you?
    My friends and I normally lose the game.

How would you improve it in the future?
    In the future, I would like to apply the "minimax" strategy for AI. When given an x depth of strategy, the AI would look x steps further to get the most tiles to be flipped.
